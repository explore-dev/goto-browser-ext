**explore.dev** is a
[Google Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/exploredev/kncanpcabelfpnpkkaeelgncohnbofml) 
for [GitHub.com](https://github.com) that augments pages with links on source code symbols to the source location where they were defined.
 
This functionality enables developers to navigate within and across repositories as if they are using the *go to definition* feature in their IDE.

We believe that developers should not have to download code to benefit from the functionalities provided by their IDE. Reading code online should be as simple as reading Wikipedia pages.


## [Tryout the Chrome extension (beta)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/exploredev/kncanpcabelfpnpkkaeelgncohnbofml)
